# Archit's React Projects Portfolio

This is a **portfolio page** showcasing my React frontend projects.  
The projects are **hosted live on Netlify** and the code is available on GitHub.

## About

- Built with **React** for interactive UI experiences.
- Portfolio page itself is built using **HTML + CSS** to showcase multiple projects in a clean card layout.
- This repo is meant to serve as a **central hub** linking my live React projects for easy demonstration.

---

## Tech Stack

- React (for individual projects)
- HTML, CSS (for portfolio page)
- Netlify (for hosting live apps)
- Git & GitHub (for version control)

---

## Notes

- Each project is hosted **independently on Netlify**, so the portfolio page only links to the live versions.
- Future projects will be added as they are completed.
